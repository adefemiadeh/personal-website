    <h2>Medical Imaging</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Medical imaging is a central application domain of my research, where I investigate deep
      learning models for disease detection, classification, and clinical decision support. My
      work emphasizes data-efficient learning and rigorous model evaluation, addressing challenges
      such as limited data availability, class imbalance, and domain variability.
  </p>

</br>

  <p>
      A core component of this research involves hyperparameter optimization and model selection,
      particularly through Bayesian optimization and related probabilistic techniques. These
      methods enable systematic performance improvements while managing computational cost, which
      is critical in large-scale medical imaging experiments.
    </p>

</br>

    <p>
      In parallel, I explore explainable AI techniques to improve model transparency and trust.
      By integrating interpretability and uncertainty-aware modeling, my research aims to bridge
      the gap between high-performing AI systems and their practical adoption in clinical workflows
    </p>

    <h2>Agentic AI Systems</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    My second major research direction focuses on agentic AI, where artificial intelligence
    systems are designed to act autonomously, reason over goals, and adapt to dynamic
    environments. This work moves beyond static prediction models toward AI systems capable
    of long-term planning, interaction, and continuous learning.
  </p>

</br>

  <p>
    I investigate how machine learning models, large language models, and optimization
    techniques can be integrated to build intelligent agents that support decision-making
    under uncertainty. Particular emphasis is placed on agentic systems in structured and
    high-stakes domains such as healthcare, scientific research, and complex system management.
  </p>

</br>

  <p>
    Through this research, I aim to contribute frameworks for intelligent agents that combine
    data-driven learning with goal-directed reasoning, supporting scalable, transparent, and
    human-aligned AI systems.
